# [Global-Wheat-Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection)

The challenge in this Kaggle competition is to detect the wheat heads and draw bounding boxes around all the detected wheat heads in the given image. Here are a few example of the predictions generated using FasterRCNN model:

  <img src="./images/preds1.png" width="250" />
  <img src="./images/preds2.png" width="250" /> 
  <img src="./images/preds3.png" width="250" />
</p>

Here are a few approaches I tried to approach the problem with brief description and achieved score on public leader board.
